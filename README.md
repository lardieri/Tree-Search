# Tree search

Breadth-first tree search using counted levels instead of building a queue.

For those devices where space is more precious than time.

(And yeah, I know: recursion chews up stack frames. But any recursive function can be turned into an iterative function if you try hard enough. It's just easier to understand the code if it's written recursively.)
